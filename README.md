# B-Alert-driver-drowsiness-system
This is a project developed as part of my B. Tech academics main project. This project aims to detect the drowsiness level of vehicle drivers and alert the driver if the system detects any drowsiness.
https://github.com/italojs/facial-landmarks-recognition/blob/master/shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat is the github link for the shape predictor file used in the project. Download this file and put all the files into a single directory before running the program.
